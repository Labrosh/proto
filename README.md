# Proto

A small narrative farming prototype, starting with a cozy morning loop.

You name your farm, pick a pet, and do a few morning actions like petting your companion, making coffee, or tending crops.

This is an early prototype designed to test tone, emotional investment, and a daily loop before building defense or survival mechanics.
